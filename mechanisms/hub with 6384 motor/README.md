# Hub with 6348 motor

This model is another attempt that I dismissed, mainly for cable management reasons:

The cable exits the motor near the shaft at the top; from there, it would need be routed to the bottom.
This isn't great but works - but from there it would also have to be routed underneath the bearing, so a larger bearing is needed
and the required base plate would need to be thicker than the 10mm bearing + cable slot, in total at least 20mm.

I did not want it be be thicker than 12mm, so dismissed this approach.

I also did not like the required 65x85 bearing; it is not as widely available and pricier than I would like.

Another option would be to grind down the shaft and move the motor higher up, but I only want to
use unaltered off-the-shelf parts.
