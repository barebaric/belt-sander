# Hub with 6348 motor

This model is only here to proove that this type of motor is unsuitable:
The cable exits the motor near the shaft; from there, it could be routed to the bottom,
but there wouldn't be space for a bearing unless the bearing is larger than the entire hub diameter,
which is a design I really did not like.
