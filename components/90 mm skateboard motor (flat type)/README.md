1. Use voltage: 24-36V
   2.24 pole stator, smooth start, high torque and high efficiency!
   3.kv value: 110KV (rotation speed of 2640rpm under 24v voltage)
2. The tire can be replaced
3. Closed bearing support at both ends, the whole motor is waterproof and dustproof.
4. Hall supports up to 60V

## Actual data identified

- 24 stator coils

- 28 slots (rotor magnets) = 14 pole pairs

- Hall sensor resolution: 6*pole pairs (=84 cpr)

- Hall sensor bandwidth 100 seems to work ok
