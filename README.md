# Belt Sander

## Version info

V1 is a rough, first prototype - not easily usable without lots of manual tweaking and not fully tested - I only printed it and assembled without a motor to find issues with the design.
V2 is work in progress and completely unusable so far.

## Changes to make in v2

- Make main housing higher to provide more clearance (1.5mm on each side?) between rollers and housing, to fit washers on both sides.
- Make left carriage bearing cutouts larger - 23mm probably. It doesn't need tight clearance, as it is pulled to the right anyway.
- Separate the carriage arm from the bracket, make them connectable using screws. For better printability/modularity.
- Make the arm shorter, to make more space for electronics in the unit.
- Make space for the new tensioner module.
- The large wheel should be built around the skateboard motor.
- Recess the tightener knob into the unit.
- Bottom could be 2mm slimmer
- Make socket and cable pocket for skateboard motor.
- Holes for switches at the top.
